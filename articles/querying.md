## What version of Monger does this guide cover?

This guide covers Monger 1.6 (including beta releases).


## Overview

Monger provides two means of querying:

 * Regular finder functions
 * Query DSL

Regular finder functions are very much similar to those in the MongoDB shell and various MongoDB drivers. For regular finders, Monger does not invent its
own query language or "syntax": you use the same document structure as you would in the shell. This makes finder functions a lot more predictable,
easier to learn and follows the convention existing MongoDB drivers have.

Finder functions belong to the `monger.collection` namespace and always take collection name as their first argument. Some of them return database
cursors (that are iterable Java objects and thus [seqable](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/seq)) that produce `DBObjects`, other (much
more commonly used) return lazy sequences of Clojure maps. This means that with Monger, you work with Clojure data structures
(collections and maps). It is natural to express documents as maps in Clojure and Monger fully embraces this idea.

Monger Query DSL is expressive and composable (we will demonstrate what it means later in this guide). It was designed for cases when you may need
to perform a sophisticated query that includes conditions, sorting, limit and/or offset and may benefit from paginating results or using advanced
MongoDB features like cursor snapshotting.


## Finding documents

To find multiple documents, use `monger.collection/find`:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc]))

(mc/insert "documents" {:first_name "John"  :last_name "Lennon"})
(mc/insert "documents" {:first_name "Ringo" :last_name "Starr"})

(mc/find "documents" {:first_name "Ringo"})
```

`monger.collection/find` takes a collection name and query conditoins and returns a database cursor you can use [clojure.core/seq](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/seq) on.
Each element of the sequence is a `com.mongodb.DBObject` instance. They can be transformed into Clojure maps using `monger.conversion/from-db-object` fn:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc])
  (:use [monger.conversion :only [from-db-object]]))

(mc/insert "documents" {:first_name "John"  :last_name "Lennon"})
(mc/insert "documents" {:first_name "Ringo" :last_name "Starr"})

(from-db-object (mc/find "documents" {:first_name "Ringo"}) true)
;= {:first_name "Ringo" :last_name "Starr"}
```

Turning the entire result set into Clojure maps is so common, however, that Monger provides a function that works exactly like `monger.collection/find` but
returns a lazy sequence of maps, `monger.collection/find-maps`:

``` clojure
;; returns all documents as Clojure maps
(mc/find-maps "documents")

;; returns documents with year field value of 1998, as Clojure maps
(mc/find-maps "documents" { :year 1998 })
```

Normally you should prefer `monger.collection/find-maps` to `monger.collection/find`, which is considered to be part of the lower-level API.

### Sorting, limits, offsets

To use sorting, limit, offset, pagination and so on, please use Monger's Query DSL (covered later in this guide).


## Finding a single document

`monger.collection/find-one` finds one document and returns it as a `DBObject` instance:

``` clojure
;; find one document by id, as `com.mongodb.DBObject` instance
(mc/find-one "documents" { :_id (ObjectId. "4ec2d1a6b55634a935ea4ac8") })
```



`monger.collection/find-one-as-map` is similar to `monger.collection/find-one` but converts `DBObject` instances to Clojure maps:

``` clojure
;; find one document by id, as a Clojure map
(mc/find-one-as-map "documents" { :_id (ObjectId. "4ec2d1a6b55634a935ea4ac8") })
```


A more convenient way of finding a document by id as Clojure map is `monger.collection/find-map-by-id`:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.finders
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc])
  (:use monger.operators))

(let [oid (ObjectId.)]
  (mc/insert "documents" {:_id oid :first_name "John" :last_name "Lennon"})
  (mc/find-map-by-id "documents" oid))
```

Normally you should prefer `monger.collection/find-one-as-map` and `monger.collection/find-map-by-id` to `monger.collection/find-one`.

### Convert a string to a MongoDB (BSON) ObjectId

To convert a string in the object id form (for example, coming from a Web form) to an `ObjectId`, instantiate `ObjectId` with an argument:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:import org.bson.types.ObjectId))

;; MongoDB: convert a string to an ObjectId:
(ObjectId. "4fea999c0364d8e880c05157") ;; => #<ObjectId 4fea999c0364d8e880c05157>
```

Document ids in MongoDB do not have to be of the object id type, they also can be strings, integers and any value you can store that MongoDB
knows how to compare order (sort). However, using `ObjectId`s is usually a good idea.

To coerce an input to `ObjectId` (instantiate one from a string of the input is a string, or just return the input if it is an `ObjectId`), there
is [monger.conversion/to-object-id](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/monger.conversion.html#var-to-object-id). 

### Convert a MongoDB (BSON) ObjectId to a string

To convert a BSON ObjectId (`org.bson.types.ObjectId` instance) to a string, just use [clojure.core/str](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/str) to
it or call `org.bson.types.ObjectId#toString` on it.


## Loading a subset of fields

Both `monger.collection/find` and `monger.collection/find-maps` take 3rd argument that specifies what fields need to be retrieved:

``` clojure
(mgcol/find-one-as-map "accounts" {:username "happyjoe"} ["email" "username"])
```

This is useful to excluding very large fields from loading when you won't operate on them.

Fields can be specified as a document (just like in the MongoDB shell) but it is more common to pass them as a vector of keywords. Monger
will transform them into a document for you.


## Reaching Into Nested Documents in Conditions

To "reach into" nested documents and use them in conditions, MongoDB uses the "dot syntax" for fields. For example, with a document
that looks like this:

``` clojure
{:address {:country "United States of America" :city "New York City" :state "New York" :zip "10001"}}
```

it is possible to address the zip field in a condition as `"address.zip"`. This is exactly how you do it in Monger in conditions and arguments for
operators like `$set`:

``` clojure
(monger.collection/find-maps "locations" {"address.zip" "10001"})
```


## Keyword and String Field Names

Clojure maps commonly use keywords, however, BSON and many other
programming languages do not have a data type like that. Intead,
strings are used as keys. Several Monger finder functions are "low
level", such as
[monger.collection/find](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/monger.collection.html#var-find),
and return `com.mongodb.DBObject` instances. They can be thought of as
regular Java maps with a little bit of MongoDB-specific metadata.

Other finders combine `monger.collection/find` with
[monger.conversion/from-db-object](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/monger.conversion.html#var-from-db-object)
to return Clojure maps. Some of those functions take the extra
`keywordize` argument that control if resulting map keys will be
turned into keywords.  An example of such finder is
[monger.collection/find-one-as-map](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/monger.collection.html#var-find-one-as-map). By
default Monger will keywordize keys.

You can use
[monger.conversion/from-db-object](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/monger.conversion.html#var-from-db-object)
and
[monger.conversion/to-db-object](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info/monger.conversion.html#var-to-db-object)
to convert maps to `DBObject` instances and back using a custom field
name conversion strategy if you need to. Keep in mind that it likely
will affect interoperability with other technologies (that may or may
not use the same naming/encoding conversion), query capabilities for
cases when exact field names are not known and performance for
write-heavy workloads.


## Using MongoDB query operators

Monger provides a convenient way to use [MongoDB query
operators](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-ConditionalOperators). While
operators can be used in queries with strings, for example:

``` clojure
;; with a query that uses operators as strings
(mc/find "products" { :price_in_subunits { "$gt" 1200 "$lte" 4000 } })
```

there is a better way to do it with Clojure. By using
`monger.operators` namespace, MongoDB $operators can be written as
Clojure symbols. $operators are implemented as macros that expand at
compile time. Here is what it looks like with operator macros:

``` clojure
(ns my.app
  (:use monger.operators))

;; using MongoDB operators as symbols
(mc/find "products" { :price_in_subunits { $gt 1200 $lte 4000 } })
```

Below are more examples that use various query operators (you can use any operator supported by the MongoDB shell with Monger):

### <, <=, >, >=

``` clojure
(ns my.app
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc])
  (:use monger.operators))

(let [collection "libraries"]
    (mc/insert-batch collection [{:language "Clojure", :name "monger"   :users 1}
                                 {:language "Clojure", :name "langohr"  :users 5}
                                 {:language "Clojure", :name "incanter" :users 15}
                                 {:language "Scala",   :name "akka"     :users 150}])
    (mc/find collection {:users { $gt 10 }}) ;= 2 documents
    (mc/find collection {:users { $gte 5 }}) ;= 3 documents
    (mc/find collection {:users { $lt 10 }}) ;= 2 documents
    (mc/find collection {:users { $lte 5 }}) ;= 2 documents
    (mc/find collection {:users { $gt 10 $lt 150 }})) ;= 1 document
```

The `$gt`, `$lt`, `$gte`, `$lte` operators work on dates and are very
commonly used for time range queries. Date values can be
`java.util.Date` instances or (highly recommended) [Joda
Time](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net) dates. If you want to use Joda
Time in Clojure, [clj-time](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time)
is a good option.

### $exists

``` clojure
(ns my.app
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc])
  (:use monger.operators)
  (import org.bson.types.ObjectId))

(let [coll "docs"
      doc1 {:_id (ObjectId.) :published-by "Jill The Blogger" :draft false :title "X announces another Y"}
      doc2 {:_id (ObjectId.) :draft true :title "Z announces a Y competitor"}
      _    (mc/insert-batch coll [doc1 doc2])
      result1 (mc/find-one-as-map coll {:published-by {$exists true}})
      result2 (mc/find-one-as-map coll {:published-by {$exists false}})]
  ;= true
  (= doc1 result1)
  ;= true
  (= doc2 result2))
```

      doc2 {:_id (ObjectId.) :counter 32}
      doc3 {:_id (ObjectId.) :counter 63}
      _    (mgcol/insert-batch coll [doc1 doc2 doc3])
      result1 (mc/find-one-as-map coll {:counter {$mod [10 5]}})
      result2 (mc/find-one-as-map coll {:counter {$mod [10 2]}})
      result3 (mc/find-one-as-map coll {:counter {$mod [11 1]}})]

```


### $group, $project, etc (MongoDB 2.2 Aggregation Framework support)

Monger supports a new feature in MongoDB 2.2, the Aggregation
Framework. It is a vast topic that is out of scope of this guide and
will be covered in a separate one when MongoDB 2.2 reaches release
candidate stages.


## More examples

These and other examples of Monger finders in one gist:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.finders
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc])
  (:use monger.operators))

;; find one document by id, as Clojure map
(mc/find-map-by-id "documents" (ObjectId. "4ec2d1a6b55634a935ea4ac8"))

;; find one document by id, as `com.mongodb.DBObject` instance
(mc/find-by-id "documents" (ObjectId. "4ec2d1a6b55634a935ea4ac8"))

;; find one document as Clojure map
(mc/find-one-as-map "documents" { :_id (ObjectId. "4ec2d1a6b55634a935ea4ac8") })

;; find one document by id, as `com.mongodb.DBObject` instance
(mc/find-one "documents" { :_id (ObjectId. "4ec2d1a6b55634a935ea4ac8") })


;; all documents  as Clojure maps
(mc/find-maps "documents")

;; all documents  as `com.mongodb.DBObject` instances
(mc/find "documents")

;; with a query, as Clojure maps
(mc/find-maps "documents" { :year 1998 })

;; with a query, as `com.mongodb.DBObject` instances
(mc/find "documents" { :year 1998 })

;; with a query that uses operators
(mc/find "products" { :price_in_subunits { $gt 4000 $lte 1200 } })

;; with a query that uses operators as strings
(mc/find "products" { :price_in_subunits { "$gt" 4000 "$lte" 1200 } })
```


## Getting Distinct Documents

To get a collection of distinct documents by field or query, use the `monger.collection/distinct` function that returns a lazy sequence
of documents. There is currently no `monger.collection/distinct-maps` or similar function so to produce a sequence of Clojure maps,
it is necessary to map (`clojure.core/map`) with `monger.conversion/from-db-object` over the results.

``` clojure
(:require [monger.collection :as mc]
          [monger.conversion :as convert])
 
;; get distinct values from the posts collection for the field category.
(mc/distinct "posts" "category")
 
;; get distinct values from the posts collection for the field category with a query.
(mc/distinct "posts" "category" {:limit 5})
 
;; convert values to maps using an anonymous function
(map
  (fn [cat] (convert/from-db-object cat false))
  (mc/distinct "posts" "category"))
```


## Monger Query DSL

Queries that need sorting (and with it, commonly
skip/limit/pagination) use Monger's Query DSL. It is composed of
functions and macros in the `monger.query` namespace, with additional
convenience operator macros from the `monger.operators` namespace.
Monger's Query DSL is heavily inspired by [SQL
Korma](http://sqlkorma.com/), is composable and easy to extend if
necessary.

Queries performed via Query DSL always return sequences of Clojure maps, like `monger.collection/find-maps` does.

Lets take a look at its core features first.

### Sorting, skip and limit

Sorting documents are specified exactly as they are in the MongoDB shell (1 for ascending, -1 for descending ordering):

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [sort find])
  (:use monger.query))

;; find top 10 scores that will be returned as Clojure maps
(with-collection "scores"
  (find {})
  (fields [:score :name])
  ;; it is VERY IMPORTANT to use array maps with sort
  (sort (array-map :score -1 :name 1))
  (limit 10))

;; find scores 10 to 20
(with-collection "scores"
  (find {})
  (fields [:score :name])
  ;; it is VERY IMPORTANT to use array maps with sort
  (sort (array-map :score -1 :name 1))
  (limit 10)
  (skip 10))
```

This example also demonstrates query conditions and fetching a subset
of fields. Note that because the order of keys matters for sorting,
you should always use array maps with `(sort ...)`. Regular Clojure
maps do not have ordering guarantees and this may lead to incorrect
sorting of results.


### Using pagination

Using `skip` and `limit` to do pagination in the query DSL is so common that Monger provides a DSL extension for that:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [sort find])
  (:use monger.query))

;; find top 10 scores
(with-collection "scores"
  (find {})
  (fields [:score :name])
  (sort {:score -1})
  (paginate :page 1 :per-page 10))

;; find scores 10 to 20
(with-collection "scores"
  (find {})
  (fields [:score :name])
  (sort {:score -1})
  (paginate :page 2 :per-page 10))
```


### Read Preference

Read preference lets MongoDB clients specify whether a query should go to the master/primary node (thus guaranteeing consistency but also
putting extra load on primaries) or it's OK to read from slaves (and thus get eventual consistency, which ocassionally may result
in slightly out of date data to be returned):

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [sort find])
  (:use monger.query)
  (:import com.mongodb.ReadPreference))

;; reads from primary (master) to guarantee consistency
;; (at the cost of putting extra load on the primary)
(with-collection coll
                  (find {:email "joe@example.com"})
                  (read-preference (ReadPreference/primary)))
```

Possible read preference values are returned by the following static methods:

 * `com.mongodb.ReadPreference/primary` (read only from master, throw an error if it is not available)
 * `com.mongodb.ReadPreference/primaryPreferred` (read from master if available, a slave otherwise)
 * `com.mongodb.ReadPreference/secondary` (read from a slave if available, otherwise throw an error)
 * `com.mongodb.ReadPreference/secondaryPreferred` (read from a slave if available, from master otherwise)
 * `com.mongodb.ReadPreference/nearest` (read from the nearest node)


### Snapshotting Cursors

A MongoDB query returns data as well as a cursor ID for additional
lookups, should more data exist.  Drivers lazily perform a "get more"
operation as needed on the cursor to get more data. Cursors may have
latent getMore accesses that occurs after an intervening write
operation on the database collection (i.e., an insert, update, or
delete).

Conceptually, a cursor has a current position. If you delete the item
at the current position, the cursor automatically skips its current
position forward to the next item. Snapshotting a cursor assures that
objects which update during the lifetime of a query are returned once
and only once. This is most important when doing a find-and-update
loop that changes.

Here is how to snapshot a cursor with Monger query DSL:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [sort find])
  (:use monger.query monger.operators))

;; performs a snapshotted query
(with-collection "documents"
                  (find {:email "joe@example.com"})
                  (snapshot))
```


### Index Hints

While not necessary in most cases, it is possible to force query to use the given index:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [sort find])
  (:use monger.query [monger.operators :only [$gt $lt]])
  (:import com.mongodb.ReadPreference))

(with-collection coll
                  (find {:age_in_days {$gt 365} :number_of_signins {$lt 3}})
                  (sort {:age_in_days -1 :number_of_signins 1})
                  (hint {:age_in_days -1 :number_of_signins 1}))
```

Hinting only makes sense in the presence of multiple compound indexes
that may be used by the optimizer and sorting by one or both indexed
fields.


### Setting batch size

Cursors fetch documents from the server in batches. It is possible to
specify the size of the batch to improve performance or limit the
number of documents returned by the server:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [sort find])
  (:use monger.query [monger.operators :only [$gt $lt]]))

(with-collection coll
                  (find {:age_in_days {$gt 365}})
                  (sort {:age_in_days -1})
                  (batch-size 5000)
```

If batch size is negative, it will limit of number objects returned,
that fit within the max batch size limit (usually 4MB), and cursor
will be closed.  For example if batch-size is -10, then the server
will return a maximum of 10 documents and as many as can fit in 4MB,
then close the cursor.  Note that this feature is different from limit
in that documents must fit within a maximum size, and it removes the
need to send a request to close the cursor server-side.


## Counting Documents

Use `monger.collection/count`, `monger.collection/empty?` and `monger.collection/any?`:

``` clojure
(ns my.service.server
  (:require [monger.collection :as mc]))

(mc/any? "documents")
;= false

(mc/empty? "documents")
;= true

(mc/insert "documents" {:first_name "John"  :last_name "Lennon"})
(mc/insert "documents" {:first_name "Ringo" :last_name "Starr"})

(mc/any? "documents")
;= true

(mc/empty? "documents")
;= false

(mc/count "documents" {:first_name "Ringo"})
;= 1

(mc/count "documents" {:first_name "Adam"})
;= 0

(mc/any? "documents" {:first_name "Ringo"})
;= true

(mc/any? "documents" {:first_name "Joe"})
;= false
```


## Working With Multiple Databases

Monger is optimized for applications that use only one database but it
is possible to work with multiple ones. For that, use
[clojure.core/binding](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/binding)
to rebind `monger.core/*mongodb-database*`,
`monger.core/*mongodb-connection*` and `monger.core/*mongodb-gridfs*`
vars to different values or use convenience functions that do that:
`monger.core/with-connection`, `monger.core/with-db`,
`monger.core/with-gridfs`. This is a common practice for Clojure
libraries. Remember that var bindings are thread-local.
